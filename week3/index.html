<b>Nickname: Shane</b>

Our Lady of The Lake School,  in Muntinlupa city

Course: Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Major in Software System

Scholarship?
Yes

Transferee / Second Course?
No

Did you choose this course? Yes / No
Why Yes?
I find software and systems interesting.

I.T. Experience: Programming / Gaming / Others
I’ve coded using python and know the basics of it due to the teachings of my previous teachers from previous subjects.

Hobbies / Interests / libangan
I like watching movies and series from different countries about different genres or topics. 
A fun fact is that I am also fascinated by sewing and fashion and have started to sew as a hobby whenever I have free time, 
I also do it when I just want to de-stress.

Goals in life / pangarap sa buhay
My goal is to be Financially independent/stable.

What do you expect to learn from this course (Web Programming)?
I expect to learn more than just about basics of web programming and to learn and experience the development of a website.

What do you want to learn to help you in your chosen Major?
To learn about both front end and back end. I want to learn about Web development in general. 
So that when the term ends, I’d have enough knowledge to make a website by myself, if that’s possible.

Any other interesting aspects of your life that you would like to share
I have already mentioned it, but lately I’ve started to like sewing, and although I’m still starting to learn, 
it’s enjoyable once you finish a sewing project. It’s just like the feeling you’ll get when you finish a coding project by yourself.

Add one or more pictures about yourself and your interests that you would like to share for your introduction.
Unfortunately, I do not have other pictures I’d like to share to the class.
