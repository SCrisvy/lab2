What do you expect to learn from this course (Web Programming)?
I expect to learn more than just about basics of web programming and to learn and experience the development of a website.

What do you want to learn to help you in your chosen Major?   
To learn about both front end and back end. I want to learn about Web development in general. 
So that when the term ends, I’d have enough knowledge to make a website by myself, if that’s possible.

Any other interesting aspects of your life that you would like to share
I have already mentioned it, but lately I’ve started to like sewing, and although I’m still starting to learn, 
it’s enjoyable once you finish a sewing project. It’s just like the feeling you’ll get when you finish a coding project by yourself.

Add one or more pictures about yourself and your interests that you would like to share for your introduction.
